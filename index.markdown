Hi! I'm a Computer Engineering student at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

My current interests are in Operating Systems, Communication Networks, Digital Design and Signal Processing. I'm using this website mainly to record new things I come across in my work, for personal reflection and for the benefit of others.

For a list of my completed projects and coursework, check the [about](https://pari-thimaalk.github.io/about/) page!
