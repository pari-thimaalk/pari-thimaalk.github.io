I'm a Junior in Computer Engineering at UIUC. When not studying, I help run [ECE391](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/ECE391/sp2024/overview.html), do research, and watch [football](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkXZRHG5RxQ). 

I occasionally play ultimate frisbee, ride my longboard and eat fried chicken with waffles. Not at the same time though.
